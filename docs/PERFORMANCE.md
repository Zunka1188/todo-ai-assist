## ðŸ“Š Performance Features

### Code Optimization
- Lazy loading of components
- Code splitting by route
- Tree shaking to remove unused code
- Minification and compression in production builds

### Caching Mechanisms
- React Query for data caching
- Local storage for persistent data
- Memory caching for frequent operations
- Service Worker for offline capabilities

### Performance Monitoring
- Custom middleware for performance tracking
- Metrics for action execution time
- Logging of slow operations (>16ms)
- Performance marks and measures for key operations

## Performance Best Practices

### Component Design
- Use React.memo for expensive components
- Implement virtualization for long lists
- Optimize re-renders with proper state management
- Extract event handlers to avoid recreation

### Data Fetching
- Use the enhanced `useCachedQuery` hook for optimal caching
- Implement pagination for large data sets
- Prefetch data when appropriate
- Handle loading and error states properly

### Asset Optimization
- Use responsive images with proper sizes
- Lazy load off-screen images
- Optimize SVGs and compress images
- Use modern image formats (WebP, AVIF)

## Performance Testing

### Tools
- Lighthouse for overall performance scoring
- Web Vitals for core metrics
- Custom performance monitoring for specific features
- React Profiler for component performance

### Key Metrics
- First Contentful Paint (FCP)
- Largest Contentful Paint (LCP)
- Time to Interactive (TTI)
- Total Blocking Time (TBT)
- Cumulative Layout Shift (CLS)

## Performance Roadmap
- [ ] Implement server-side rendering for critical routes
- [ ] Further optimize bundle size
- [ ] Add real user monitoring (RUM)
- [ ] Enhance offline capabilities
