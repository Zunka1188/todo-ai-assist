## Rate Limiting

The application implements API rate limiting to protect against abuse and ensure fair resource usage. Rate limits are applied on a per-endpoint basis:

- **Global limit:** 60 requests per minute by default
- **Authentication endpoints:** 10 requests per 5 minutes
- **Standard API endpoints:** 60 requests per minute

When a rate limit is exceeded:
- The request is blocked
- A 429 status code is returned
- A "Retry-After" header indicates when to retry
- The client is blocked for a specified time period

## Retry Logic

API requests are automatically retried in case of transient failures:

- **Default configuration:** 3 retry attempts
- **Backoff strategy:** Exponential backoff with jitter
- **Retryable status codes:** 408, 429, 500, 502, 503, 504
- **Retry delay:** Starting at 500ms, up to 5000ms maximum

## Data Encryption

Sensitive data is protected using industry-standard encryption:

- **In-transit:** All API requests use HTTPS/TLS
- **At-rest:** Sensitive fields are encrypted before storage using AES-256
- **Storage privacy:** Secret keys are never stored in plain text
- **Data fields:** Specific fields can be marked as sensitive for automatic encryption/decryption

## Offline Support

The application maintains functionality when connectivity is lost:

- **Request queuing:** API requests are queued when offline
- **Background sync:** Automatic synchronization when connectivity returns
- **Data persistence:** Critical data is cached locally with TTL controls
- **Encryption:** Sensitive offline data remains encrypted

## Best Practices

- **Authentication tokens** are stored securely and never in plain text
- **CSRF protection** is implemented for state-changing operations
- **Content Security Policies** restrict resource loading
- **Input validation** is applied to all user inputs before API transmission
- **Rate limiting** protects against brute force and DoS attacks

## Developer Guidelines

1. **Never** hardcode API keys or secrets in client-side code
2. Always use the `api` client for making requests to leverage security features
3. Mark sensitive fields appropriately with `sensitive: true` in API options
4. Use offline support for operations that need to work without connectivity
5. Test rate limiting behavior in development to ensure proper client behavior

## Monitoring & Alerts

- Rate limit breaches are logged and monitored
- Suspicious API usage patterns trigger alerts
- Encryption failures are escalated immediately
